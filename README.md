## Why Web Developing :question:

Be a Web developer has become a __must have ablity__ for me, lately.
This world simply amazes me and makes me feel free to use my *imagination* and design skills to create something :new:.
That's the reason why ever since I discovered Web development domain , I completely fell in love with it :heart.

I believe that it's always good to learn some new *_expertises_*, which, in my opinion, adds a plus to someone's personality and an intellectual background growth from each experience.
I love to, always, leave my personal touch on everything that I do :smile:

<!-- Task Lists -->
Once i decided to learn how to code I immediately started to self-study at home, up to now  i have already completed many sections and got some certificates:

- [x] CSS
- [x] HTML
- [ ] JavaScript
- [x] Applied Visual Design
